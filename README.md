# Saudi Resilience

Amid challenges and global crises, **Saudi Arabia stands tall** — guided by faith, determination, and unity.  
This project, *Saudi Resilience*, documents how the Kingdom turned every crisis into a story of strength, belief, and collaboration.

It takes you through the vital sectors that shaped the nation’s resilience:  
- **Health:** From the heart of the pandemic to a fully digital ecosystem.  
- **Education:** From classrooms to world-class e-learning.  
- **Economy:** Sustaining progress and megaprojects despite global slowdowns.  
- **Technology:** The bridge that connected people and powered innovation.  

The **Vision 2030** page presents a chronological journey — from the Vision’s launch to its accelerated milestones during the pandemic. It shows how, by the grace of Allah then through visionary leadership, the crisis became a catalyst that strengthened digital transformation and national efficiency.  

The **About** page offers a broader look at how Saudi Arabia faces challenges — with faith, calm, and strategic action — becoming a global example of balanced strength and trust.  

The **Film – Hard Phase** page delivers a symbolic short story about turning hardship into hope, and difficulty into inspiration.  

This website is simple in structure yet elegant in design, reflecting gratitude, pride, and resilience.  
It features both **light and dark themes**, with smooth animations that create a calm, immersive experience.  

**Saudi Resilience** is more than a website —  
it’s a reminder that every challenge carries hidden blessings,  
that gratitude is the first step to growth,  
and that Saudi Arabia, by the grace of Allah, keeps moving — even when the world stands still.
