                    <h3>The Regulatory Sandbox</h3>
                    <p>This was the game-changer. The "Sandbox" allows startups to test new, innovative products in a live (but controlled) environment, under SAMA's supervision, before getting a full license. This is how giants like Tamara and Tabby were born.</p>

                    <p>A new mandate forcing traditional banks to create APIs. This allows authorized FinTech apps (with your permission) to access your bank data, enabling services like all-in-one budget trackers, smart investment tools, and faster loan applications.</p>

                    <h3>Fintech Saudi</h3>
                    <p>Not a regulator, but a government-backed *enabler*. Launched by SAMA and CMA, its entire mission is to act as a "coach" — accelerating the industry, connecting startups with investors, and building a community of talent to drive the sector forward.</p>
